# BankersAlgorithm
For this project,  a multithreaded program implements the banker’s algorithm . Several customers request and release resources from the bank. The banker will grant a request only if it leaves the system in a safe state. A request that leaves the system in an unsafe state will be denied. This programming assignment combines three separate topics: (1) multithreading, (2) preventing race conditions, and (3) deadlock avoidance.
